const is a promise that once a variable 
gets its value, it won't change. However, 
that value can be decided while the program 
is already running (like a user's input).

constexpr is a much stricter promise. 
It says the value must be decided while 
the code is being compiled.
If the compiler can't figure it out then, 
it will throw an error.
