* .find() as a member function of the std::string class 
used to search for a sequence of characters within a string.

When you use s1.find(target), the function looks through s1 
for the first occurrence of target. If it finds it, 
it returns the index (the position) where that substring starts.

If the sub_str is not found, func returns value that's 
std::string::npos (npos=no position) which is very large number*/
